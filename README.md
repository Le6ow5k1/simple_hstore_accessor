# SimpleHstoreAccessor

Simple Hstore Accessor allows you to treat fields on an hstore column as though they were actual columns in Rails 3.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "simple_hstore_accessor"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_hstore_accessor

## Setup

The `store_accessor` method accepts the name of the hstore column you'd
like to use and an array representing fields to be stored in that column.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  store_accessor :options, :color, :price
end
```
